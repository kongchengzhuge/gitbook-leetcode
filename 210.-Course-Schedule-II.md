# 210. Course Schedule II

## problem description

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

## algorithm thought

同之前第一题一样，都是用拓扑排序，只是这里将排好序之后的结果输出。只需要在过程中加入数组记录即可

## code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        vector<int> indegree(numCourses,0);
        for(int i=0;i<prerequisites.size();++i){
            graph[prerequisites[i][1]].push_back(prerequisites[i][0]);
            indegree[prerequisites[i][0]]++;
        }
        vector<int> res;
        while(numCourses){
            int tmp=-1;
            for(int i=0;i<indegree.size();++i){
                if(indegree[i]==0){
                    tmp=i;
                    indegree[i]=INT_MAX;
                    numCourses--;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(tmp==-1){
                if(numCourses==0)
                    return res;
                return {};
            }
            res.push_back(tmp);
            for(int i=0;i<graph[tmp].size();++i){
                indegree[graph[tmp][i]]--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## algorithm analysis

同第一题分析，时间复杂度和空间复杂度都是O(n²)
